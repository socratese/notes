# FREE SERVER

The goal of the free server is to funnel users into one of two outcomes:
1. Joining the paid server.
2. Growing the free server community (and therefore leading to more members joining the paid server).

## Value Proposition

To grow this community, we will provide the following value:
- **Giveaways**
- **Important updates about Bandit**
- **Q&As**
- **Competitions**
- **Showcasing Bandit users' success**

Having Bandit users return to the free server to post their success stories and testimonials creates social proof, which is crucial for convincing others that success is possible for them too.

## Community Growth Strategy

The most important factor is maintaining a constant influx of new users. Despite building up 400+ users, once they joined the waitlist, they had no reason to return to the free server, which led to a decline in activity. When new users consistently join, asking when they can be let into the paid server, it creates **hype** and **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**.

## Affiliates

We can set up affiliate partnerships by allowing interested individuals to open an affiliate ticket. We offer two potential affiliate structures:

1. **Free Server Affiliate** (pay per member joined):
   - 500 members: $250
   - 1000 members: $350
   - 2500 members: $500  
   (Figures are subject to agreement)

2. **Paid Tier Affiliate Links** (pay per signup):
   - 0-20% commission (estimated)

## TODO

- Figure out where to source young content creators to manage TikTok and Instagram accounts.
- Offer a reward system and gamify the process (e.g., leaderboards).

# MEMBER ON-RAMP (PAID SERVER)

The **member on-ramp** is a new member's first impression of the product/service. Our goal is to inspire them, show them the potential, and ensure they are not overwhelmed or confused. Based on research and feedback from other owners, here's the flow:

### Onboarding Flow

1. **Member joins via Whop**.
   - The only visible channel is `START HERE`.
   - This channel:
     - Welcomes the user.
     - Explains what Bandit is and emphasizes its exclusivity.
     - Outlines a **timeline**: The first month focuses on getting $1,000 in free items, with a long-term goal of making thousands passively through sales channels.
     - Provides a welcome guide with instructions on server use, ordering, and requesting help.

2. At the end of the `START HERE` channel, the user reacts to open a ticket with staff.
   - **Ticket process**:
     - Reinforce Bandit’s value, inspire the member, and share testimonials.
     - Understand their goals (e.g., making money, selling on Amazon, personal use).
     - Based on their experience, assign relevant roles (experienced/newcomer).
     - Use the ticket for follow-ups, especially after 2 weeks, to ask for reviews on Whop.

3. If a member achieves a **checkout/success**, praise them! Everyone loves recognition, and it encourages them to stay.

### Key Steps for Onboarding Success:

1. Welcome the user as an owner/staff.
2. Assign one staff per ticket to reduce confusion and workload.
3. Understand their goals (make money, sell on Amazon, etc.).
4. Reinforce that success is possible (cite examples).
5. Ensure they believe in the process.
6. Assess their experience with Discord/bots.
7. If experienced, assign an appropriate role and check in if needed.
8. If inexperienced, walk them through basic bot commands and guide usage.
9. Celebrate every success!
10. Introduce new features, such as using the private site list in the bot.
11. Follow up after a week and introduce them to the software.
12. Provide check-ins during the first week.
13. Encourage them to seek help when needed, but ensure they’re proactive in using guides.
14. After their first success, request a testimonial or review.
15. Assign new roles as they progress.
16. Maintain open communication through the ticket for ongoing support.
